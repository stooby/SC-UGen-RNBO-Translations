[SuperCollider-UGen-RNBO-Translations]
=========================
This is a collection of Max RNBO abstractions featuring "rnboscript" translations of SuperCollider UGen source code.

The purpose of this is to make SuperCollider UGen DSP available in Max and all the export targets RNBO supports (VST3, Javascript for Web, C++, Raspberry Pi. etc.)

**[RNBO](https://supercollider.github.io/downloads)** is a library and toolchain that can take Max-like patches, export them as portable code, and directly compile that code to targets like a VST, a Max External, or a Raspberry Pi.

**[SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/)** is a platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition, used by musicians, artists, and researchers working with sound.

Setup:
----------
• A version of Max that supports RNBO is required
• Put this repository (including the .rnbopat files) in a directory w/in your Max search patch to ensure the RNBO abstractions can be loaded in your Max projects.
